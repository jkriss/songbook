[Verse 1]
C
I know a guy that's got a lot to lose.
       F
He's a pretty nice fellow but he's kind of confused.
         C
He's got muscles in his head that ain't never been used.
                           G
Thinks he own half of this town.
 
C
Starts drinking heavy, gets a big red nose.
F
Beats his old lady with a rubber hose,
        C
then he takes her out to dinner and buys her new clothes.
                        G          C
That's the way that the world goes 'round.
 
[Chorus]
C
That's the way that the world goes 'round.
       F
You're up one day and the next you're down.
     C
It's half an inch of water and you think you're gonna drown.
                        G          C
That's the way that the world goes 'round.
 
[Verse 2]
C
I was sitting in the bathtub counting my toes,
         F
when the radiator broke, water all froze.
      C
I got stuck in the ice without my clothes,
                       G
naked as the eyes of a clown.
 
C
I was crying ice cubes hoping I'd croak,
         F
when the sun come through the window, the ice all broke.
  C
I stood up and laughed thought it was a joke
                        G          C
That's the way that the world goes 'round.
 
[Chorus]
C
That's the way that the world goes 'round.
       F
You're up one day and the next you're down.
     C
It's half an inch of water and you think you're gonna drown.
                        G          C
That's the way that the world goes 'round.
 
[Chorus]
C
That's the way that the world goes 'round.
       F
You're up one day and the next you're down.
     C
It's half an inch of water and you think you're gonna drown.
                        G          C
That's the way that the world goes 'round.
 
[Chorus]
C
That's the way that the world goes 'round.
       F
You're up one day and the next you're down.
     C
It's half an inch of water and you think you're gonna drown.
                        G          C
That's the way that the world goes 'round.
 
[Outro]
                        G          C
That's the way that the world goes 'round
                        G                  C        C
That's the way that the world........ goes 'round
