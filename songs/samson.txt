B       C#m        B      E
[B]  You are  [C#m]my sweetest down-fall
   F#       G#m            F#        E
I loved you first,      I loved you first
            B         C#m     B        E
Beneath the sheets of paper lies my truth
   F#    G#m     F#      E
I have to go, I have to go
               F#                   E
Your hair was long,  when we first met

F#  G#m         B
Sam - son  went back to bed
                  E
Not much hair left on his head
   F#     G#m      B               G#m                F#
He ate a slice of wonder bread and went right back to bed
   E        G#m       B                    B            E         
And history books for-got about us and the bible didn't mention us
         B     F#     G#m                E         
And the bi-ble didn't mention us, not even once

B       C#m     B     E
You are my sweetest downfall
   F#       G#m        F#       E
I loved you first, I loved you first
            B         C#m     B        E
Beneath the stars came fallin' on our heads
            F#      G#m             F#       E        
But they're just old light, they're just old light
               F#                 E
Your hair was long when we first met

F#    G#m       B
Sam - son came to my bed
                  E
Told me that my hair was red
               F#   G#m       B            F#
Told me I was beautiful and came into my bed
      E       F#       G#m       B          
Oh I cut his hair my - self one night
                              E
A pair of dull scissors in the yellow light
                           B
And he told me that I'd done alright
      B                   G#m   
and kissed me 'til   the mornin' light, the mornin' light
         B                   G#m
and he kissed me 'til   the mornin' light

Sam - son went back to bed
                  E
not much hair left on his head
               F#     G#m      B                  F#
Ate a slice of wonderbread and went right back to bed
         E        F#        G#m     B
Oh, we couldn't bring the columns down
         F#           B     E
Yeah we couldn't destroy a single one
                     B
And history books forgot about us
         B      F#     G#m                   E         
And the bible  didn't  mention us, not even once....
