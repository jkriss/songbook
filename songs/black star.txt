[D]  [Dsus4]  [Em7]    [Cadd9]   [G/B]   [A7sus4]

[G]I get home from work[Csus2/9] and you're still [G/B]standing in your [Dadd4/F#]dressing gown
Well [Em]what am I to do?
[G]I know all the [Csus2/9]things around your [G/B]head [Dadd4/F#]
And what they [Em]do to you
What are we [Cadd9]coming to?  What are we [Bm]gonna do?[D]     

Chorus:
[D]Blame it [D7/9]on [D6/9]the [Am]Black Star[G/B]  [Cadd9]
Blame it [Cadd9]on the [Am]falling[G/B] [Cadd9]sky
[D]Blame it on the [G]satellite[Cadd9]  [G]        That [Gsus4]beams [G]me home[D]

The troubled words of a troubled mind 
I try to understand what is eating you
I try to stay awake but its 58 hrs since that I last slept with you
What are we coming to?
I just don't know anymore

Chorus

I get on the train and I just stand about now that I don't think of you
I keep falling over I keep passing out when I see a face like you
What am I coming to?  
I'm gonna melt down

Chorus

[D]   [G/B]  [Cadd9] [G/B] [Am]
