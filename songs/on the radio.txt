[C]This is how it works It [G]feels a little worse
[Am]Than when we drove our hearse Right [F]through that screaming crowd
[C]While laughing up a storm [G]Until we were just bone
[Am]Until it got so warm That [F]none of us could sleep
[C]And all the styrofoam [G]Began to melt away
We [Am]tried to find some words To [F]aid in the decay
But [C]none of them were home In[G]side their catacomb
A [Am]million ancient bees Be[F]gan to sting our knees
While [C]we were on our knees [G]Praying that disease
Would [Am]leave the ones we love And [F]never come again

[C]On the radio
[G]We heard November Rain
[Am]That solo's really long
[F]But it's a pretty song
[C]We listened to it twice
[G]'Cause the DJ was asleep

This is how it works
You're young until you're not
You love until you don't
You try until you can't
You laugh until you cry
You cry until you laugh
And everyone must breathe
Until their dying breath

No, this is how it works
You peer inside yourself
You take the things you like
And try to love the things you took
And then you take that love you made
And stick it into some
Someone else's heart
Pumping someone else's blood
And walking arm in arm
You hope it don't get harmed
But even if it does
You'll just do it all again

And on the radio
You hear November Rain
That solo's awful long
But it's a good refrain
You listen to it twice
'Cause the DJ is asleep
On the radio
(oh oh oh)
On the radio
On the radio - uh oh
On the radio - uh oh
On the radio - uh oh
On the radio
