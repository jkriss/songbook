{subtitle:Gillian Welch}

[Am]Caleb Meyer he lived alone
In them hollering [G]pines
And he made a little whiskey [D]for himself
Said it helped to pass the [Am]time

[Am]Long one evening in back of my house
Caleb came [G]around
And he called my name till [D]I went out
With no one else [Am]around

{start_of_chorus}
[Am]Caleb Meyer your ghost is gonna
Wear them rattling [G]chains
But when I go to [D]sleep at night
Don't you call my [Am]name
{end_of_chorus}

[Am]"Where's your husband Nellie Cane
Where's your darling [G]gone?
Did he go on down the [D]mountainside
And leave you all [Am]alone?"

[Am]"Yes my husband's gone to Bowling Green
To do some business [G]there."
Then Caleb threw that [D]bottle down
And grabbed me by the my [Am]hair

{start_of_chorus}
[Am]Caleb Meyer your ghost is gonna
Wear them rattling [G]chains
But when I go to [D]sleep at night
Don't you call my [Am]name
{end_of_chorus}

He [Am]threw me in the needle bed
Across my dress he [G]lay
Then he pinned my hands a[D]bove my head
And I commenced to [Am]pray

I [Am]cried my God I am your child
Send your angels [G]down
Then feeling with my [D]finger tips
The bottle neck I [Am]found

I [Am]drew that glass across his neck
Fine as any [G]blade
Then I felt his blood pour [D]fast and hot
Around me when I [Am]laid

{start_of_chorus}
[Am]Caleb Meyer your ghost is gonna
Wear them rattling [G]chains
But when I go to [D]sleep at night
Don't you call my [Am]name
{end_of_chorus}
