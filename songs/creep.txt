{title:Creep}
{subtitle:Radiohead}

When you were here [G]before
Couldn't look you in the [B]eyes
You look like an [C]angel
Your skin makes me [Cm]cry

You float like a [G]feather
In a beautiful [B]world
I wish I was [C]special
You're so fucking [Cm]special

Chorus:
But I'm a [G]creep
I'm a [B]wierdo
What the hell am I doin' [C]here
I don't belong [Cm]here

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I wanna perfect body
I want a perfect soul

I want you to notice
When I'm not around

You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special

Chorus

Oooh
She's running away
She's running
She's
Running a...
Run, run, run
Run

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fucking special
Wish I was special
But I'm a creep
