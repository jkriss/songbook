All this [C]talk of getting old
It's getting me [Am]down my love
Like a cat in a [Em]bag, waiting to [F]drown
This [G]time I'm [C]comin' down

And I [C]hope you're thinking of me
As you lay down [Am]on your side
Now the drugs don't [Em]work
They just make you worse[F]
But I [G]know I'll see your [C]face again
Now the drugs don't work[Em]
They just make you worse[F]
But I [G]know I'll see your [C]face again

But I know I'm on a losing streak
'Cause I passed down my old street
And if you wanna show
Then just let me know
And I'll sing in your ear again

Now the drugs don't work[Em]
They just make you worse[F]
But I [G]know I'll see your [C]face again

'Cause baby [F]ooh  [G]
if heaven [Am]calls
I'm coming [G]too
Just like you [F]said   [G]
if you leave my [Am]life
I'm better off [G]dead

All this [C]talk of getting old
It's getting me [Am]down my love
Like a cat in a [Em]bag
waiting to drown[F]
This [G]time I'm [C]comin' down

Now the drugs don't work[Em]
They just make you worse[F]
But I [G]know I'll see your [C]face again

'Cause baby [F]ooh  [G]
if heaven [Am]calls
I'm coming [G]too
Just like you [F]said  [G]
if you leave my [Am]life
I'm better off [F]dead

But if you wanna [Em]show
                   F
then just let me [F]know
And I'll [G]sing in your [C]ear again

Now the drugs don't work[Em]
They just make you worse[F]
But I [G]know I'll see your face[C] again

[C]Yeah, I know I'll see your face again
[C]Yeah, I know I'll see your face again
[C]Yeah, I know I'll see your face again
[C]Yeah, I know I'll see your face again

[C]I'm never coming down, no I'm never coming down
[C]No more, no more, no more, no more, no more
[C]never coming down, no I'm never going down   
[C]No more, no more, no more, no more, no more
