[C]Nowhere man
And the whiskey [F]girl
[Dm]Nowhere man
And the whiskey [C]girl
[G]They loaded up for
A [F]weekend in the [C]underworld

I'd take you down
Honey if I could
I'd take you down
Honey if I could
We'd find a place
In the sunshine
We'd be feeling good

[C]       [F]       [Dm]     [C]
[G]       [F]       [C]

[C]Don't you know
That it ain't a [F]crime
[Dm]Don't you know
That it ain't a [C]crime
[G]If all the squares
And the [F]junkmen
Think you're out of [C]line

Nowhere man
And the whiskey girl
Nowhere man and
The whiskey girl
They loaded up for
A weekend in the underworld
