What Makes You Beautiful
One Direction

[Liam]
          E     A
You're insecure
               B
Don't know what for
                 E             A                B
You're turning heads when you walk through the door
                E
Don't need make up
A           B
  To cover up
           E            A       B
Being the way that you are is enough
 
[Harry]
 E         A           B
Everyone else in the room can see it
 E         A       B
Everyone else but you
 
[Chorus]
          E            A          B
Baby you light up my world like nobody else
              E             A             B
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
              E             A             B
But you when smile at the ground it aint hard to tell
            E      A
You don't know (oh oh)
    B
You don't know you're beautiful!
  E       A          B
If only you saw what I can see
             E            A             B
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
               E          A          B
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
            E      A
You don't know (oh oh)
    B
You don't know you're beautiful
 E    A
(Oh oh)
 B
That's what makes you beautiful!

[Zayn]
           E
So c-come on
A              B
  You got it wrong
               E          A       B
To prove I'm right I put it in a so-o-ong
             E
I don't know why
A             B
 You're being shy
          E            A             B
And turn away when I look into your eye eye eyes
