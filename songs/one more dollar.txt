{title:One More Dollar}
{subtitle:Gillian Welch}

A [G]long time ago [D] I left my [G]home
For a [C]job in the [G]fruit trees
But I [G]missed those hills [D] with the windy [G]pines
For their [C]song seemed to [G]suit me

So I [G]sent my wages [D] to my [G]home
And said we'd [C]soon be [G]together
For the [G]next good crop [D]would pay my [G]way
And [C]I would come home [G]forever

{start_of_chorus}
[Em]One [D/F#]more [C]dime to [D]show for my [G]day
[Em]One [D/F#]more [C]dollar and [D]I'm on my [G]way
When I [Em]reach [D/F#]those [C]hills, boys, [D] I'll never [G]roam
[Em]One [D/F#]more [C]dollar and [D]I'm going [G]home
{end_of_chorus}

No work said the boss at the bunk house door,
There's a freeze on the branches,
So when the dice came out at the bar downtown,
I rolled and I took my chances

(CHORUS)

A long time ago I left my home
Just a boy passing twenty
Could you spare a coin and a Christian prayer
For my luck has turned against me

(CHORUS)

One more dollar, boys I'm going home
