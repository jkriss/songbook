Well the [D]birds were talkin’ [A]all at once
And the [Em]old [G]man mowin’ down his lawn
[A]He didn’t look like much too bad a [D]guy

And I was thinkin’ “Hang on, man, somethin’s wrong
Your blues they do seem to be gone,”
Heaven ain’t bad but you don’t get nothin’ done

[F#]Lay down your head [G]awhile
[D]You are not [A]needed now
You are not needed now[D]

Well Allison laid an egg on me
And every time I turn around
It’s swimmin’ through the air above my bed

And I told Miss Hicks and she said fine
Long as you’re back in your room on time
I’ll keep you clean the girls will keep you fed

Lay down your head with mine
You are not needed now
And we got things to do

Well between the blankets made of wool
The trains go by every half an hour
And a body can’t get no restin’ done it’s true

So I spend my time as best I can
Thinkin’ big and makin’ plans
And wonderin’ where them trains are rollin’ to

Lay down your head poor boy
Feel how the ground does move
And hear how them drivers sing

Well goodbye friends it’s time to close
Everybody knows that’s the way it goes
Where was it you lived in case I’m ever there?

Well three doors down and two behind
And it gets a little bit out of hand sometimes
Don’t let it fool you into thinkin’ you don’t care

Lay down your head and fly
And I’ll quietly pass you by
You won’t even see me go

Well if I thought about it long enough
I just might make some kind of move
Watchful eyes are too hard on the soul

With the smokehouse just across the way
And this fog upon the light of day
I’d be hard pressed comin’ up with where to go

Lay down your head poor boy
Feel how the ground does move
And hear how them drivers sing

And what now my darling one?
We’ll go find a little fun
You are not needed now
