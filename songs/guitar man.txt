Guitar Man
Cake

G
Who draws the crowd?
     C
Who plays so loud?
                 D
Baby it's the guitar man
G
Who's gonna steal the show
     C                  D
You know baby it's the guitar man
       Em                   C
He can make you love he can make you cry
        Em
He will bring you down
        Am
He will get you high
C
Something keeps him going 
Bm
Miles and miles away
   Am                     D
To find another place to play
    G                      C
And night after night who treats you right 
               D
Baby it's the guitar man
G
Who's on the radio?
     C                  D
You know baby it's the guitar man
        Em                            C
When he comes to town and you see his face
        Em                      Am
And you think you might like to take his place
C                            Bm
Something keeps him drifting miles and miles away
Am                         D
Searching for the songs to play
         Am            Am (G# bass)    G            D
Then you listen to the music and you'd like to sing along
         G              G (F# bass)    E
And you want to get the meaning out of each and every song
        Am              Am (G# bass)     G                  D
And you find yourself a message and some words to call your own
             E
and take 'em home
 
G C D G C D
 
       Em                   C
He can make you love he can get you high
        Em                     Am
He will bring you down he will make you cry
C
Something keeps him moving
    Bm
But no one seems to know
Am                        D
What it is that makes him go
         Am              Am (G# bass)    G                D
Then the lights begin to flicker and the sound is getting dim
    G               G (F# bass)    E
The voice begins to falter and the crowds are getting thin
       Am             Am (G# bass)     G           D
But he never seems to notice he's just got to find another place
   E
