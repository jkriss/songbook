Perfect Blue Buildings
Counting Crows

Just down the street from your hotel, baby
I stay at home with my disease
And aint this position familiar, darling
Well, all monkeys do what they see
Help me stay awake, Im falling...

Down on virginia and la loma
Where I got friends wholl care for me
You got an attitude of everything I ever wanted
I got an attitude of need
Help me stay awake, Im falling...

Asleep in perfect blue buildings
Beside the green apple sea
Gonna get me a little oblivion, baby
Try to keep myself away from me

Its 4:30 a.m. on a tuesday
It doesnt get much worse than this
In beds in little rooms in buildings in the middle of these lives which are completely meaningless
Help me stay awake, Im falling...

Asleep in perfect blue buildings
Beside the green apple sea
Gonna get me a little oblivion, baby
Try to keep myself away from me

I got bones beneath my skin, and mister...
Theres a skeleton in every mans house
Beneath the dust and love and sweat that hangs on everybody
Theres a dead man trying to get out
Please help me stay awake, Im falling...

Asleep in perfect blue buildings
Beside the green apple sea
Gonna get me a little oblivion, baby
Try to keep myself away from me

I cant keep myself away from me
How am I gonna keep myself away from me
