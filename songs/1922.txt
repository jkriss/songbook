Well I worked all summer couldn't save a cent
I gave all my money to the government
I don't know quite how it got spent
but the banks are coming for my deed though
Man at the mill can't see though
Let me get my feed for free though
Ain't that the way it is

I cut out down a braver road
I traded my stock for a V84
Danced for town down on the floor boards
And the title owed down to me though
That gasoline ain't free through
Just guzzling out my knee bone?
Ain't that the way it is

Well i met me a woman down in saint paul
with a little money and a little pole
Bloke told me that he'd bust my jaw
I talked to his sister again though
Don't mean I couldn't win though
There's blood running down my chin now
Ain't that the way it is

Well I slept all night on the bar room floor
and woke up this morning my head was sore
Pockets empty but I want some more
The bar man's got my car though
Tales worth more by far though
As I leave her down at the bar now
Ain't that the way it is

Well I hitched me a ride on the way back home
I got me a job on a family farm
Times are hard here but I can't roll?
and I ain't got nothing more
Oh that company store
Gold's looking good for sure though
Ain't that the way it is

Well I worked all summer counldn't save a cent
I gave all my money to the government
I don't know quite how it got spent
but the banks are coming for my deed though
Man at the mill can't see though
Let me get my feed for free though
Ain't that the way it is
