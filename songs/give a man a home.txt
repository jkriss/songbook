{title:Give a Man a Home}
{subtitle:Ben Harper}

[D]    [A]   [Bm]    [G]

Have you [D]ever lost [Bm]your way
Have you [A]ever feared [G]another day
Have you [D]ever misplaced your [Bm]mind
[A]Watching this world leave [G]you behind

[D]Won't you
won't you [A]give
won't you [Bm]give a man
give a [G]man a home

Have you ever worn thin
Have you ever never known where to begin
Have you ever lost your belief
Watching your faith turn to grief

Won't you
Won't you give
Won't you give a man
Give a man a home

In a world that is unwhole
You have got to fight to keep your soul
Some would rather give than receive
Some would rather give up before they believe

Won't you
Won't you give
Won't you give a man
Give a man a home
