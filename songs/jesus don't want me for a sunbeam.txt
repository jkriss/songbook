[E]Jesus don't [D]want me for a [A]sunbeam 
[E]Sunbeams are [D]never made like [A]me 
[E]Don't expect me to [D]cry, for all the [A]reasons you [D]had to [A]die 
[E]Don't ever [D]ask your love of [A]me

[E]Don't expect me to [D]cry, 
[E]Don't expect me to [D]lie, 
[E]Don't expect me to [D]die, 
for [A]thee  [D]   [A]
