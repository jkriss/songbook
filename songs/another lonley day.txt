{title:Another Lonely Day}
{subtitle:Ben Harper}

[C]Yes indeed[Am] I'm [Em]alone [G]again
[C]and here comes [Am]emptiness [Em]crashing [G]in
[C]it's either [Am]love or hate 
I can't [Em]find in [G]between
cause [C]I've been with [Am]witches
and I have [Em]been with a [G]queen

Chorus:
[F]It wouldn't have [Am]worked out any [G]way
so now it's just [C]another lonely [Am]day  [Em]   [G]
[F]further [Am]along we just [G]may
but for now it's just [C]another [Am]lonely day [Em]   [G]

Wish there was something 
I could say or do
I can resist anything
but temptation from you
but I'd rather walk alone
then chase you around
I'd rather fall myself 
then let you drag me down

Chorus

Yesterday seems like a life ago
cause the one I love 
today I hardly know
you I held so close in my heart oh dear
grow further from me 
with every fallen tear
 
Chorus
