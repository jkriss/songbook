Song for Loren B.
Charlie Parr

i know every crack in every sidewalk
well i know every building on every block
'cause i walk these streets from sunrise to dawn
looking for a corner where i can lay me down

i spend my days picking up dirty cans
walking thirteen miles to collect 85 cents
well i'm waiting in hospital while others go ahead
standing on the corner begging for some bread

well, i ain't got no home on this world anymore
beaten down by that vice that i never asked for
my soul cries for freedom, but my feet want no more
and if i had the strength to fight, they'd lock me away for sure

shadows from the campfire hide garbage on the ground
morning after the ashes tell me where i'm bound
broken down boxcars hide my camp from the world
well they parked 'em here on rusty tracks and no one said a word

i recognize the faces that wait in the lines outside
well i listen to the preachers; fire and redemption cry
the police stand coldly with an eye on their guns
well we are criminals and sinners, far away from home

well, i ain't got no home on this world anymore
beaten down by that vice that i never asked for
my soul cries for freedom, but my feet want no more
and if i had the strength to fight, they'd lock me away for sure
