Excuse Me Mr.
Ben Harper

Oh - excuse me Mr. 
Do you have the time, 
Or are you so important that it stands still for you? 
Excuse me Mr. 
Want you lend me your ear, 
Or are you not only blind but do you not hear? 
Excuse me Mr. but isn't that your oil in the sea, 
And the pollution in the air Mr., 
Whose could that be? 

So, excuse me Mr. 
But I'm a mister too. 
And you're givin' Mr. a bad name, 
Mr. like you. 
And, I'm taking the Mr. from out in front of your name, 
'cause it's a Mr. like you that puts the rest of us to shame. 
It's a Mr. like you that puts the rest of us to shame. 

And I've seen enough, 
Oh - I've seen enough, 
I've seen enough to know that I've seen too much. 

Excuse me Mr. 
Can't you see the children dying? 
You say that you can't help them, 
Mr. you're not even trying. 
Excuse me Mr. 
Just take a look around. 
Oh, Mr. just look up and you will, 
You'll see it's coming down. 
Oh, excuse me Mr. but I'm, I'm a mister too. 
And you're givin' Mr. a bad name, 
Mr. like you.

I've seen en..., I've seen en..., 
I've seen enough to know that I've seen too much.

Oh - I've seen enough to know that I've seen too much. 

'cause Mr. when you're rattling on heaven's gate. 
By then it is too late. 
'cause Mr. when you get there, 
They don't ask what you saved. 
All they'll want to know Mr. is what you gave. 
So, excuse me Mr. 
But I'm a mister too. 
And you're givin' Mr. a bad name, 
Mr. like... you. 

So, I'm taking the Mr. from out in front of your name, 
'cause it's a Mr. like you puts the rest of us to shame.

Oh...
