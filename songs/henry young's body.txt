{title:Henry Young's Body}
{subtitle:Charlie Parr}

may of 1859 i was pushing coal in a virginia mine
my wife at home, son was gone
killed by a shotgun blast

my name is henry james young
i was born in 1821
raised in loam?
10 and 0
i am a little poor

the iron brown stood at the mine's head gate
reaching out blood and wash out hate
his own son's gone he stood alone
we must stop this now

i signed on for the weekend raid
laid down my pick and with my pay
i bought a gun, left my home
i kissed my wife goodbye

cried captain john i want to take my life home with me
captiain john i want to take my life home with me

sun set on in amel stowe
where we were ahead and it was sure we
stormed the post, snapped the boards
arms of the oppressed poor

captain john i want to take my life home with me
captain john i want to take my life home with me

captain john raised his gun and howled 
rested(?) his glove and slid down the saddle
they raised the law, the soldiers swarmed
they've four times the number of us

captain john i want to take my life home with me
captain john i want to take my life home with me

i kneeled down to take my aim
my insides burst and my legs gave way
my unfired gun lay on the ground
my blood colored like the cold

captain john i want to take my life home with me
captain john i want to take my life home with me

captain john laid over me
touched my head and spoke softly
now you be strong
we nearly won
he held my bloody hand in his

captain john i want to take my life home with me
captain john i want to take my life home with me

tell my wife i bid goodbye
i surely do not want to die
we almost won
this i know
we'll die before the cause is wone

captain john i want to take my life home with me
captain john i want to take my life home with me

captain john went on alone
he had with him my new gun
my last sound, his initial round
a fallen soldier dies with me

captain john i want to take my life home with me
captain john i want to take my life home with me
