Reincarnation Song
Toad the Wet Sprocket

I thought I'd be alright today
I thought I'd be alive today
Give me your eyes, I'll show you things
You never dreamed you thought you'd see

I found myself in a light I'd seen in sleep sometimes or mescaline
and like the sun you can't stare into very long without it blinding you

I thought this light would comfort me
I thought it would be easy
But there's a tugging at my sleeve
so much baggage I brought with me to leave

something so big i can't understand from trying to i would go mad
so i hurry back to little earth for another life, another birth

another life another birth

mother?
