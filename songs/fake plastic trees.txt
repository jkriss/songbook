[A]
Her [A]green plastic watering can [F#m]
For her fake chinese rub[E]ber [D]plant
In the fake [A]plastic [D]earth
[A]That she bought from a rubber man [F#m]
In a town full of rub[E]ber [D]plans
To get [A]rid of [D]itself

It wears her [Bm]out
It wears her [A]out
It wears her [Bm]out
It wears her [A]out
 
She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns

He used to do surgery
For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins
 
And it wears him out
It wears him out
It wears him out
It weeeeeaaaars
 
She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing
My fake plastic love
 
But I can't help the feeling
I could blow through the ceiling
If I just turn and run
 
And it wears me [Bm]out
It wears me [A]out
It wears me [Bm]out
It wears me [A]out
And if I could [Bm]be who you wanted
If I could [A]be who you wanted
All the [Bm]time
All the [A]time
