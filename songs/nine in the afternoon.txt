Nine in the Afternoon
Panic at the Disco

[Verse]
C
Back to the street where we began
                                   Am
Feeling as good as lovers can you know
            F
Yeah we're feeling so good
C
Picking up things we shouldn't read
                                        Am
It looks like the end of history as we know
               F
It's just the end of the world
C                        G/B
Back to the street where we began
Am                  G/B                  C    F
Feeling as good as love, you could, you can
C
Into a place where thoughts can bloom
                                        Am
Into a room where it's nine in the afternoon
        F
And we know that it could be
C
And you know that it should
                               Am
And you know that you feel it too
 
[Chorus]
             F                C
'Cause it's nine in the afternoon
                       G/B         Am
And your eyes are the size of the moon
                                Em
Your good 'cause you can so you do
 
We're feeling so good
          F
Just the way that we do
                           C
When it's nine in the afternoon
                   G/B         Am
Your eyes are the size of the moon
                                Em
Your good 'cause you can so you do
                      F   C
We're feeling so good
 
[Verse]
                   C
Back to the street
                 C
Down to our feet
                                  Am
Losing the feeling of feeling unique
        F
Do you know what I mean?
C
Back to the place
 
Where we used to say
                                Am
"Man it feels good to feel this way"
       F
Now I know what I mean
 
C                  G/B
Back to the street
                  Am
Back to the place
              G/B                C     G/B Am
Back to the room where it all began
 
             G/B                   C
Back to the room where it all began
 
[Chorus]
              F                C
'Cause it's nine in the afternoon
                   G/B          Am
Your eyes are the size of the moon
                                Em
Your good 'cause you can so you do
Em
We're feeling so good
          F
Just the way that we do
                            C
When it's nine in the afternoon
                   G/B         Am
Your eyes are the size of the moon
                                Em
Your good 'cause you can so you do
 
We're feeling so good
          F
Just the way that we do
                            C
When it's nine in the afternoon
 
[Clapping+Piano/Keyboard part]
                                   Am
Your eyes are the size of the moon
                                   Em
Your good 'cause you can so you do
 
We're feeling so good
          F
Just the way that we do
                             C
When it's nine in the afternoon
