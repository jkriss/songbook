[Bm]    [G] [Em]    [G]
[Bm]    [G] [Em]    [G]
[Bm]    [G] [Em]    [G]
[Bm]    [G] [Em]    [G]

I am the [Bm]key to the lock [G]in your [Em]house
[G]That keeps your [Bm]toys in the [G]basement [Em]
[G]And if you [Bm]get too [G]far inside[Em]
[G]You'll only [Bm]see my [G]reflection[Em]

It's always best when the light is off
I am the pick in the ice
Do not cry out or hit the alarm
You know we're friends till we die

Chorus:
And either way you [Em]turn
I'll be [G]there
Open up your [Em]skull
I'll be [G]there
Climbing up the [Em]walls

It's always best when the light is off
It's always better on the outside
Fifteen blows to the back of your head
Fifteen blows to your mind

So lock the kids up safe tonight
Put the eyes in the cupboard
I've got the smell of a local man
Who's got the loneliest feeling

That either way he [Em]turns
I'll be [G]there
Open up your [Em]skull
I'll be [G]there
Climbing up the [Em]walls
Climbing up the [Em]walls
Climbing up the [Em]walls
