{subtitle:Counting Crows}

[Am]My friend assures me, "It's all or nothing."
[G]I am not worried, I am not overly concerned
[Am]My friend implores me, "For one time only,
[G]Make an exception. "I am not worried."
[Am]Wrap her up in a package of lies. Send her off to a coconut island
[G]I am not worried. I am not overly concerned 
[Am]with the status of my emotions. "Oh," she says, "you're changing."
But we're [G]always changing. It does not bother me to say â€“

[Em]This isn't love
[C]Because if you don't want to [D]talk about it [Em]then... it isn't love
[C]And I guess I'm gonna have to [D]live with that
But I'm [Em]sure there's something in a shade of [C]grey
Or something in [D]between
And [Em]I can always change my [C]name
If that's [D]what you mean

My friend assures me, "It's all or nothing."
But I am not really worried. I am not overly concerned
You try to tell yourself the things you try to tell yourself 
To make yourself forget. I am not worried.. 

"If it's love," she said, 
"Then we're going to have to think about the consequences."
She can't stop shaking I can't stop touching her and

This time when kindness falls like rain It washes her away and Anna begins to change her mind
"These seconds when I'm shaking leave me shuddering for days," she says
And I'm not ready for this sort of thing

[Am] But I'm not going to break
And I'm not going to [G]worry about it anymore
I'm not going to [Am]bend and I'm not going to break
And I'm not going to [G]worry about it anymore

[Am]It seems like I should say, "As long as this is love..."
[G]But it's not all that easy... so maybe I should
[Am]Snap her up in a butterfly net
Pin her down on a photograph album
[G]I am not worried
I've done this sort of thing before 

[Em]But then I start to [C]think about the [D]consequences
[Em]Because I don't get no [C]sleep in a [D]quiet room and

[G]This time when [C]kindness falls like [Em]rain
It [D]washes me [G]away 
And [C]Anna [Em]begins to [D]change my [G]mind
And [C]everytime [Em]she sneezes I [D]believe it's love and
[G]Oh [C]Lord, [Em]I'm not ready [D]for this sort of [G]thing

She's talking in her sleep
It's keeping me awake and
Anna begins to toss and turn
And every word is nonsense but I understand and
Oh Lord, I'm not ready for this sort of thing

Her kindness bangs a gong
It's moving me along and Anna begins to fade away
It's chasing me away
She disappears and
Oh Lord, I'm not ready for this sort of thing
